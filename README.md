# Arduino Soil Humidity Reader

This is source code for an Arduino soil humididy reader. Just set the conditionals to the optimal percentage soil humidity range for your plant, and the LEDs will light up according to those levels. The LEDs indicate when the best time is to water your plant, and the overal soil humidity percentage is also printed to the LCD screen.
